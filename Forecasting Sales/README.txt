Project Title
Forecasting Sales of Beachfront Restaurants

Objective
The objective of this project is to forecast future sales for beachfront restaurants using historical sales data and create visualizations to derive insights from the predictions.

Key Components
Data Description

Item Table: Contains item details such as ID, name, cost, and calories.
Restaurant Table: Includes store details like ID and name.
Sales Stream Table: Stores sales transactions with date, item count, item ID, and price.
Process Workflow

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed sales trends, item popularity, and yearly patterns using Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Machine Learning Model:
Implemented XGBoost to forecast future sales based on the historical data (3 years).
Output File: Generated a file with forecasted sales values by store, item, month, and other dimensions.
Visualization

Python Visualizations:
Total sales by date and item count.
Top 10 items by forecasted sales.
Sales trends filtered by specific years.
Power BI Reports:
Overview Page: KPIs (Total Sales, Sales Growth YOY, Average Price) and sales trends by store.
Yearly Trends Page: Total sales and item count by year, dynamic store-specific analysis.
Additional page for forecasting sales insights using the predicted data.
Tools Used
Python: EDA, model implementation, and visualization.
XGBoost: Machine learning model for sales forecasting.
Power BI: Interactive reports and dashboards.
Outcome
The project provides an end-to-end workflow from data analysis to machine learning-based forecasting and visualization. It offers actionable insights for restaurants to plan inventory and optimize sales strategies.
